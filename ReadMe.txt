IMPORTANT NOTE: Starting from this new repository, heavy binaries are moved out of Ogitor Source Control. 
The directories "RunPath/Media" and "RunPath/Projects" are now available as a seperate download. 
To be able to build and run Ogitor, you will need the following files downloaded and extracted into "RunPath" folder:

http://www.ogitor.org/media.zip
http://www.ogitor.org/projects.zip

Please download those files and extract them to "RunPath" folder in your SOURCE path before building and installing Ogitor.
